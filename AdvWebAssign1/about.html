            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Born in Brazil, raised in the World! That would be the best phrase to describe me. I was born in Brazil, back in 1987, in a town called Belo Horizonte (5.5 milion people). When I was only 1 my family moved to Rio de Janeiro with me, and there we spent 10 years. After we went back to Belo Horizonte, and be the time, I was already fooling arround with the computer's family, trying to understand how to start <b>Windows&copy;</b> from the MsDOS console. I was 16 when i gave my first thoughts about traveling abroad.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">On my 18's, I first steped outside Brazil. I went to Maryland, US, to work on a ski resort called &quot;<b>Wisp Resort</b>&quot; I spent the winter over there, working in quite a few different positions, such as snowboard technician, snowboard instructor, assistant in the kitchens resort and as a housekeeper in the resort hotel. By the end of the winter I had decided thet i didn't want to go back to Brazil, so I bought flight tickets to Europe, I went straight to Barcelona, Spain. In Europe, between Andorra, France and Spain, I spent total of 4 years. In the meantime I did all sort of jobs, from doorman/security from discos to photographer, untill cheef assistant. Oe thing I can tell, it was a singular and priceless experience that no money in this world can buy.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After those 4 long years I've decided to go back to Brazil, and take a break, but instead a break, faster then ever I've manage to work for 4 months as a salesman for <b>Cirque du Soleil</b> as they were in a tour in Brazil. By the time I was done with them, I had enough money to buy from my mom her own business. A retail shop, called <b>Lar dos Presentes</b> that sells house utilities and weeding gifts. For 4 years I was ahead of the business.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Between deceptions and disillusions with my own country and with the people that runs it, I gave a lot of thoughts and decided to get my degree, and that is the part of the story that Canada comes in with the main role, and here I am, putting so manu effort to learn all those new languages and syntaxes.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I hope tha in a brief way, I was able to tell a little about me and my story. Feel free to visit my website since there is plenty of materials to come. Once more, I would like to thank you, and I look forward for your next visit. And remember, Never stop wondering.</p>
